        <h3>Vodka</h3>
        <p class = "upperPar"><em class = "upperDrinkInfo">The History of Whisky:</em>In the 11th century, Celtic monks brought the art of distillation
            to Ireland, and they really only made wine. But on this island, it simply wasn't 
            possible to grow. They had to be content with beer made from fermented barley, and by
            1494, Whisky was first mentioned in a Scottish document. The first documented distillery
            was Bushmills in Ireland, in 1608. When the French wine supply was halved by pests
            in the late 18th century, the Scots were cut off from buying any. But one Scotsman had 
            an idea: Why not store Whisky in sherry casks like cognac? The new concept was a major
            success, and led Whisky to the rest of the world. Today, it's well known as one 
            of the most popular liquors to both mix and enjoy on it's own all around the world, 
            being used in many of the best drinks ever made, some of which are listed below.<em class = "upperDrinkInfo">What's
            the difference between Whiskey and Whisky?</em> There are a couple reasons why the
            different spellings came to be, but today, it's just where the drink is from.
            In the USA and Ireland, it's Whiskey. In Scotland and Canada, it's Whisky. Throughout
            this page, they're used often interchangeably.

                    The screwdriver was one of the first recorded cocktails made with vodka,
                    and similar to other early drinks, wasn't made in a bar.There are many 
                    potential stories for how the drink came about. One says it was made by 
                    American oil workers in the Persian gulf in the middle of the 20th century.
                    While working, they wanted a drink. So, they added some Vodka to their 
                    orange juice, and stir it with a screwdriver as that's what they had on hand.
                    Another possibility is that it was made by American marines during WW2,
                    while other stories say it was invented by Turkish intelligence agents, Balkan
                    refugees and American engineers in the Park Hotel. However it came to be, it's 
                    now enjoyed as one of the easiest go-to drinks there is.

                    The moscow mule is a popular vodka drink, which helped introduce
                    more vodka to the states. It was invented in 1941, and a couple people
                    lay claim to it's creation. John G. Martin, an exec and marketer
                    at Heublein drinks company (who had recently acquired smirnoff), 
                    claimed that he and Jack Morgan made it (the owner of the Los
                    Angeles British pub Cock n' Bull). However, the head bartender of
                    the club, Wes Prince, says he made the original, which is a bit more believable.
                    Prince said he just wanted to "clean out the basement", as the bar
                    had too much ginger beer and vodka wasn't selling well either. 
                    Another notable fact Morgan's girlfriend owned a company that made
                    copper products, thus leading to the copper mugs we now know.
