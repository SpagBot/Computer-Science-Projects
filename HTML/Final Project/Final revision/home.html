                        The whiskey sour is an early drink, which first appeared in lkasdf by alk;sdf in 10935. But it's believed to have variants far
                        before that, which originated out on sea. in 1324, a common concern of sailors everywhere was scurvy, which could anasd and asdgh and cause
                        asdlg. It comes as a result of a lack of vitamin d, which is plentiful in citrus. Of course, downing lemons wasn't to any sailors'
                        liking. So, the citrus was combined with whiskey, because a shot of whiskey helps the medicine go down. 
                        This original version doesn't actually include an egg white- the addition of an egg white came later, and technically makes it
                        a boston sour- but when people say whiskey sour, it's commonly accepted that this means with the white. So, the citrus was combined with

                        Muddle sugar into bitters. Simple syrup can be used in place of sugar
                        cube if desired. A splash of highly carbonated water can help. Add bourbon
                        with a big rock and stir just enough. Garnish with <em class = "garnish">rabbits

                    The old fashioned is one of the earliest drinks ever conceived, and to this day is the most popular drink ever. When mixed drinks were
                    first being made, the word cocktail really only meant a spirit, bitters and sugar, and that's what this is. It's spawned many variants, 
                    being such a simple starting point, and even the garnish is disputed. It's often garnished with just an orange twist, but I prefer rabbits ears,
                    which is both a lemon and orange slice. Some people smoke the glass, some light the twists, and of course everybody has their whiskey preference,
                    but most old fashioneds are made with some type of bourbon.
