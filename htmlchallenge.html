			<strong>The Roman Forum is a rectangular forum</strong> (plaza) surrounded 				
			by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the centre 
			of the city of Rome. Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, 
			originally a marketplace, as the <strong><em>Forum Magnum</strong></em>, 
			or simply the Forum.
			<br><br>
			It was for centuries the centre of Roman public life: the site of triumphal 
			processions and elections; the venue for public speeches, criminal trials, 
			and gladiatorial matches; and the nucleus of commercial affairs. Here statues 
			and monuments commemorated the city's great men. The teeming heart of ancient 
			Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world, and 
			in all history. Located in the small valley between the Palatine and 
			Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural 
			fragments and intermittent archeological excavations attracting numerous sightseers.

		   
		<h2>History</h2>
		
		<h3>Roman Kingdom</h3>
			
			The original, low-lying, grassy wetland of the Forum was drained in the 7th 
			century BC with the building of the <em>Cloaca Maxima</em>, a large covered 
			sewer system that emptied into the Tiber River, as more people began to settle 
			between the two hills.
			<br><br>
			According to tradition, the Forum's beginnings are connected with the alliance 
			between Romulus, the first king of Rome controlling the Palatine Hill, and his 
			rival, Titus Tatius, who occupied the Capitoline Hill. An alliance formed after 
			combat had been halted by the prayers and cries of the Sabine women. Because 
			the valley lay between the two settlements, it was the designated place for 
			the two peoples to meet. Since the early Forum area included pools of stagnant 
			water, the most easily accessible area was the northern part of the valley 
			which was designated as the Comitium. It was here at the Vulcanal that, 
			according to the story, the two parties laid down their weapons and formed 
			an alliance.
		 
		<h3>Roman Republic</h3>

			During the Republican period the Comitium continued to be the central location
			for all judicial and political life in the city. However, in order to create
			a larger gathering place, the Senate began expanding the open area between 
			the Comitium and the Temple of Vesta by purchasing existing private homes and
			removing them for public use. Building projects of several consuls repaved 
			and built onto both the Comitium and the adjacent central plaza that was 
			becoming the Forum.
			<br><br>
			The 5th century BC witnessed the construction of the earliest Forum temples 
			with known dates of construction: the Temple of Saturn (497 BC) and the Temple 
			of Castor and Pollux (484 BC).  The Temple of Concord was added in the 
			following century, possibly by the soldier and statesman Marcus Furius Camillus. 
			A long held tradition of speaking from the elevated speakers' Rostra - originally 
			facing north towards the Senate House to the politicians and assembled elite - put 
			the orator's back to the people assembled in the Forum. A tribune known as Caius 
			Licinius (consul in 361 BC) was supposed to have been the first to turn away from
			the Roman elite towards the people in the Forum, an act symbolically repeated 
			two centuries later by Gaius Gracchus.


		<h3>Roman Empire</h3>

			After Julius Caesar's death, and the end of the subsequent Civil Wars, Augustus 
			would finish his great-uncle's work, giving the Forum its final form. This 
			included the southeastern end of the plaza where he constructed the Temple of 
			Divus Iulius and the Arch of Augustus there (both in 29 BC). <strong>The Forum 
			was witness to the assassination of a Roman Emperor in 69 AD:</strong> Galba 
			had set out from the palace to meet rebels, but was so feeble that he had to
			be carried in a litter. He was immediately met by a troop of his rival Otho's 
			cavalry near the Lacus Curtius in the Forum, where he was killed.
			<br><br>
			During these early Imperial times much economic and judicial business transferred 
			away from the Forum to larger and more extravagant structures to the north. After
			the building of Trajan's Forum (110 AD), these activities transferred to the
			Basilica Ulpia.
